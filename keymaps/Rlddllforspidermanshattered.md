## Solution 1: Disable or uninstall your antivirus software
 
Some antivirus software may falsely detect the rld.dll file as a threat and delete it from your game folder. To prevent this, you can try disabling or uninstalling your antivirus software temporarily and see if the game works. If it does, you can add the game folder to your antivirus software's exclusion list or whitelist to avoid future problems.
 
## Solution 2: Allow the rld.dll file through Windows Defender
 
Windows Defender is a built-in security feature of Windows that can also block the rld.dll file from running. To allow the rld.dll file through Windows Defender, you can follow these steps:
 
1. Open Windows Defender Security Center from the Start menu or the taskbar.
2. Click on Virus & threat protection.
3. Click on Virus & threat protection settings.
4. Scroll down and click on Add or remove exclusions.
5. Click on Add an exclusion and select Folder.
6. Browse to your game folder and select it.
7. Click on Yes to confirm.

After adding the game folder to the exclusion list, you can try launching the game again and see if the error is gone.
 
## Solution 3: Download and install the rld.dll file manually
 
If none of the above solutions work, you can try downloading and installing the rld.dll file manually from a reliable source. However, this method is not recommended as it may expose your computer to malware or viruses. You should only download the rld.dll file from a trusted website and scan it with your antivirus software before installing it. To download and install the rld.dll file manually, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to https://www.dll-files.com/rld.dll.html and click on Download.
2. Select the version of the rld.dll file that matches your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) and click on Download Zip File.
3. Extract the zip file to a folder on your computer.
4. Copy the rld.dll file from the extracted folder and paste it into your game folder (usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Spider-Man - Shattered Dimensions).
5. Restart your computer and launch the game.

If you still get the rld.dll error after trying these solutions, you may need to contact Activision's customer support or reinstall the game completely.
