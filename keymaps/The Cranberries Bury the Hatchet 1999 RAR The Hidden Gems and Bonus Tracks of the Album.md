The Cranberries are an Irish alternative rock band that rose to fame in the early 1990s with hits like "Linger", "Zombie" and "Dreams". After a disappointing reception for their fourth album, To the Faithful Departed (1996), which saw them experiment with a heavier and more political sound, the band took a break from recording and touring. In 1999, they came back with their fifth album, Bury the Hatchet, which marked a return to their original style of melodic pop-rock with folk influences.
 
Bury the Hatchet was released on April 19, 1999, by Island Records. It was produced by Benedict Fenner, who had previously worked with artists like David Bowie and Brian Eno. The album features 13 tracks, plus six bonus tracks on the Complete Sessions edition. The album's title refers to the band's intention to put their past troubles behind them and start anew. The album's cover art features a close-up of a baby's face, symbolizing innocence and hope.

The album also performed well commercially, reaching the top ten in several countries and selling over five million copies worldwide. The album spawned four singles: "Promises", "Animal Instinct", "Just My Imagination" and "You and Me". The singles were accompanied by music videos that showcased the band's playful and humorous side.

The Cranberries embarked on a world tour to support the album, playing over 100 shows in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. The tour was a success, attracting large crowds and positive feedback from fans and critics. The band also performed at several festivals and TV shows, including MTV Unplugged, where they played acoustic versions of their songs. The tour was documented on the live album Beneath the Skin - Live in Paris (2001), which also featured some new songs and covers.
 
After the tour, the band took another hiatus to focus on their personal lives and solo projects. O'Riordan released two solo albums, Are You Listening? (2007) and No Baggage (2009), while the other members formed a new band called Mono Band. The Cranberries reunited in 2009 and released two more albums, Roses (2012) and In the End (2019), before O'Riordan's tragic death in 2018. Bury the Hatchet remains a beloved album by fans and a tribute to the band's talent and spirit.
  
Bury the Hatchet showcases the diverse musical influences and styles of The Cranberries. The album ranges from upbeat and catchy pop-rock songs like "Animal Instinct" and "Just My Imagination" to dark and haunting ballads like "Shattered" and "Dying in the Sun". The album also features some experimental tracks like "Copycat", which uses a drum machine and a distorted guitar riff, and "Fee Fi Fo", which incorporates a children's choir and a string section. The album's lyrics deal with themes such as love, betrayal, forgiveness, loneliness and death.
