But did you know that Inunaki Tunnel is based on a real place? Inunaki Tunnel (or Inunaki Village) is a real tunnel located in Miyawaka town, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. It is a famous horror spot where people have been killed or burnt to death[^2^]. The tunnel was built in 1949 and abandoned in 1975 when a new tunnel was constructed nearby. The old tunnel became dangerous due to a lack of maintenance and was rumored to be haunted by ghosts and evil spirits.
 
Some people believe that Inunaki Tunnel is a place where the laws of Japan do not apply, and that anything can happen there. There are stories of people being kidnapped, tortured, murdered, or possessed by demons in the tunnel. Some even say that there is a portal to hell inside the tunnel, and that anyone who enters will never come back.
 
Inunaki Tunnel is a game that tries to capture the horror and mystery of this place. You play as a journalist who decides to investigate the tunnel after receiving a mysterious phone call from someone who claims to be trapped inside. You have to use your flashlight, camera, and phone to find clues and escape from the tunnel before it's too late.
 
Inunaki Tunnel is a game that will test your nerves and your sanity. It has realistic graphics, immersive sound effects, and jump scares that will make you scream. If you are looking for a thrilling and scary experience, you can download Inunaki Tunnel for free from Steam and see if you can survive the horrors of the tunnel.

Inunaki Tunnel is not the only game by Chilla's Art, a small indie game studio that specializes in horror games.
