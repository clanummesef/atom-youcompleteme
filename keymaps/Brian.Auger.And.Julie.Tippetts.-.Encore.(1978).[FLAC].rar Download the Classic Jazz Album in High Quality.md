The album received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Eminem's lyrical skills and delivery, but criticized some of the production choices and the excessive use of humor. Some reviewers also felt that the album lacked the intensity and controversy of Eminem's previous albums. The album has a Metacritic score of 64 out of 100, based on 26 reviews. Pitchfork gave the album a 6.5 out of 10, saying that "Encore is a fourth fascinating record from Eminem, but it's also easily his weakest and, in many ways, tamest album to date." Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars, calling it "a phenomenally gifted musician and lyricist doing all the things he does best." The New York Times gave the album a mixed review, stating that "Encore is almost willfully uneven: it includes some of the most exhilarating songs Eminem has ever recorded, alongside some of the most inert."
 
The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling over 700,000 copies in its first week. It also topped the charts in several other countries, including Canada, Australia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The album was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA, and has sold over 11 million copies worldwide. The album spawned four singles: "Just Lose It", "Encore", "Like Toy Soldiers" and "Mockingbird". "Just Lose It" and "Like Toy Soldiers" both reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while "Mockingbird" peaked at number 11. "Encore" was a collaboration with Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, and was released only as a bonus track on a special edition of the album.
